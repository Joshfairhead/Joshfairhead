### About - Sensemaker/Lunatic

Identity... hmmm, tough one to express generically but I'll try! Ok - so as a singular entity I'd consider my inner thought as integral or non-dual, my inner landscape is often occupied with the philosophy of language and/or symbol manipulation which I see as expressive capacity.  As an embodied being I enjoy various forms of coordinated movements, excersise and myofascial mobilisations - such as board-sports, dancing, circus arts, swimming, surfing, playing musical instruments or long walks on the beach/mountains!
<br> </br>
As a collective being I tend to associate with divergent communities - people working on something radically different from the current status quo of extraction and zero sum games. The Tao which can be named is not the eternal Tao, so I won't try to articulate the intereior collective any further :). Lastly we have the exterior collective to identitfy with; and for me thats spaceship earth. Nationalisim has never worked for me, I've been the English person in Ireland and the Irish person in England - tribalistic in/out groups tend to bring issues. When the aliens come I'll cease to identify as a citizen of earth and instead as one of the syntropic Kosmos. 

In that regard, given we're likeley connected as part of a giant autopoietic network that is cognizient and conscious on every level, I might as well cease to identity at all! âœ¨
