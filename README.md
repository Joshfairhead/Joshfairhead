### Hallo! Do you like my badge?

I chose it because I'm the air, trees, soil and water - embodied living universe both on the macro and micro scales.
<br> </br>
In that regard, I'm simply asserting that I dont exist in a vacuum and neither do you! Thats it - were connected as part of this giant autopoietic network that is cognizient and probably conscious on every level! âœ¨
